## Getting Started

```
npm start
```

This will start the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the production build of your application.

## Usage

1. Add your React components in the `src/components` directory.
2. Add your SASS files in the `src/components/sass/components` directory.
3. Import your SASS files into your React components as needed.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `Background` component in your `App` component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Background from './components/Background';

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Background />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
